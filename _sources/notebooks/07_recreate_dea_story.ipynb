    "In this notebook, we show how the plots used in the Dea User Story **[“A glacier digital twin component to inform hydropower outlook”](https://dea.destine.eu/web/stories/viewer/684039a1b62b202b54ee0271)** can be recreated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The user story\n",
    "\n",
    "The user story focuses on the **summer of 2015**, when Iceland faced a major challenge for its hydropower system. During this period, glacier runoff was exceptionally low, leading to serious concerns about electricity production. We use the tools provided by **DTC-Glaciers** to explore how a **glacier digital twin** can help to better understand, anticipate, and manage such events in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hydropower and glaciers in Iceland\n",
    "\n",
    "More than **80% of Iceland’s electricity** is generated from **hydropower**. These power plants have been historically developed and operated by **[Landsvirkjun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsvirkjun)**, Iceland’s national power company, and they play a key role in the country’s low-carbon energy system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rahnj%C3%BAkar_Hydropower_Plant)** is the largest hydropower plant in Iceland, with an annual production of around **4,600 GWh**. It is supplied by a catchment area of **1,660 km²**, of which **72% is covered by glacier ice**. Most of this ice belongs to **Brúarjökull**, an outlet glacier of **[Vatnajökull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull)**, the largest ice cap in Iceland.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The summer of 2015 was highly unusual\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cold weather** and **persistent cloud cover** led to a much **later** and **weaker melt season** than normal. As a result, glacier runoff was strongly reduced. According to Landsvirkjun, this was **one of the worst melt seasons** ever observed for their reservoirs (Source: [International Water Power Magazine](https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/analysis/managing-hydro-operations-in-iceland-4831665/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "By **August, river flow rates** were still **very low**. This raised serious **concerns** about **electricity supply** and even led to **discussions about emergency measures** for the coming winter. In the end, heavy precipitation later in the summer refilled the reservoirs, and power rationing could be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This event clearly shows the need for better preparedness.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters for the future\n",
    "\n",
    "While the summer of 2015 was exceptional, **similar conditions** can **occur again**. Years with **positive glacier mass balance** can reduce meltwater availability and create comparable **challenges for hydropower production**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we treat the year **2015 as a hindcast**. This means we use it as a real-world test case to evaluate how well future forecasts might perform under similar conditions.\n",
