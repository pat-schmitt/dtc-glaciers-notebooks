These are preliminary notebooks. They are part of the [DTC Glaciers](https://dtcglaciers.org) project, funded by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/).

- [Calibrating OGGM Mass Balance with CryoSat-2 Observations](notebooks/04_calibration_with_eolis_data) demonstrates how to use DTCG to calibrate OGGM using CryoSat-2 observations to model Iceland's glacier mass balance.
- [Comparing Models to Observations Using Datacubes](notebooks/07_explore_datacubes.ipynb) provides instructions on streaming datacubes via DTCG.
- [Glacier runoff in the Alps](notebooks/01_alps.ipynb) presents another way to use the DTCG API to access and visualise glacier runoff data in the Alps.
- [CryoSat2 - model comparison at Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland](notebooks/02_iceland.ipynb) compares state of the art global glacier modelling products with EO data at Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland.
- [MCS Workflow Example](notebooks/05_mcs_workflow_example) shows how to calibrate OGGM using Monte Carlo simulations.
- [Surface Type Workflow](notebooks/06_sfc_type_workflow) demonstrates OGGM's new surface tracking feature, and a novel way to derive snowline altitude.

This project has just started! The notebooks presented here are a first iteration of the data assimilation and visualisation pipeline and serve as a baseline from which we will build upon. Check back for updates soon, and if you are interested in contributing, please get in touch!
